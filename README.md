# SpareTime Teaching
SpareTime Teaching is a group of students arranging talks outside the curriculum.
Anyone can hold a talk, and topics range from lambda-calculus to game development, 
to anything else CS-related.

# I've got an IDEA
Is a workshop I'm holding 03. November - 2015, this repository contains the exercises 
used during the workshop. For the slides, check out http://sparetimeteaching.dk/ after
the workshop.

You should start looking in the FirstSteps exercises, then in the DrawingBlocks 
exercises. The exercises are written for Windows/Linux, but a Mac user should be able 
to convert the keybindings easily.

**Disclaimer:** This is the first revision of the exercises, it's very possible that 
there are bugs / errors or other imperfections.
